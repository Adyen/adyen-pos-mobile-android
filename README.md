# Adyen POS Mobile SDK for Android

This is the home page of the Adyen POS Mobile SDK for Android. 
Our mobile solution lets you accept in-person payments on an Android device, using a card reader that is connected via Bluetooth.

The repository contains a small sample app which can be used to get started with using our SDK.

To build the project you need to define some variables in your `local.properties` file locally.
```
# URL and credentials to the Maven repository
artifacts.url=<URL of the repository>
artifacts.username=<Your username>
artifacts.token=<Your access token to the repository>
# Credentials to the Adyen TEST environment
environment.apiKey=<Your API key>
environment.merchantAccount=<Your merchant account>
```

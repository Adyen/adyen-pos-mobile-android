# Automatic Initialization

Automatic initialization of the SDK is simple and covers most of the cases.
There is no specific step, the SDK does everything out of the box.

For manual initialization see example [README.md](../app-manual-initialization/README.md).

# Authentication

See [MyAuthenticationService.kt](src/main/java/com/adyen/sampleapp/MyAuthenticationService.kt) 
for example of how the authentication code can be implemented.
